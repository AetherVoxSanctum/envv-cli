# ⚠️ THE PROBLEM: Traditional .env files expose secrets
#
# Anyone with access to this file can see your production secrets:

ANALYTICS_KEY_GOOGLE=GA-987654321
ANALYTICS_KEY_MIXPANEL=abc123def456
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_live_4242424242424242
BACKEND_SECRET_KEY=super-secret-production-key
PORT=3000

# Problems with plaintext .env files:
# 1. Visible in screenshots and screen shares
# 2. Stored in plaintext on every developer's machine
# 3. Show up in search results and file explorers
# 4. Accidentally shared via email/Slack
# 5. Remain in trash/recycle bin after deletion
# 6. Visible in crash dumps and logs
#
# ✅ SOLUTION: Run ./setup-working-demo.sh to encrypt these secrets
# The app will work exactly the same but secrets will be encrypted at rest
